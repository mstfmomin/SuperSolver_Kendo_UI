            <p>
                Information we collect and how we use it</p>
            <p>
                We may collect the following types of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information you provide --</strong> When you sign up for a SuperSolver Account
                    we ask you for personal information. We may combine the information you submit under
                    your account with information from other SuperSolver services or third parties in
                    order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our
                    services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining
                    such information.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies --</strong> When you visit SuperSolver, we may send one or more
                    cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality
                    of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results
                    and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people use our services,
                    monitor aggregate site usage metrics, and monitor and analyze the effectiveness
                    of the Services and third party marketing activities. SuperSolver also uses cookies
                    in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage
                    ads across the web and on SuperSolver services.</li>
                <li><strong>Log information --</strong> When you access SuperSolver services via a browser,
                    application or other client our servers automatically record certain information.
                    These server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction
                    with a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date
                    and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your
                    browser or your account.</li>
                <li><strong>User communications --</strong> When you send email or other communications
                    to SuperSolver, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries,
                    respond to your requests and improve our services. When you send and receive SMS
                    messages to or from one of our services that provides SMS functionality, we may
                    collect and maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone
                    number, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the content of the
                    message, and the date and time of the transaction. We may use your email address
                    to communicate with you about our services.</li>
                <li><strong>Affiliated SuperSolver Services on other sites --</strong> We offer some
                    of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide
                    to those sites may be sent to SuperSolver in order to deliver the service. We process
                    such information under this Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Party Applications --</strong> SuperSolver may make available third
                    party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through its services. The information
                    collected by SuperSolver when you enable a third party application is processed
                    under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application
                    provider is governed by their privacy policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Information --</strong> The Services are primarily designed to
                    help you share information with others, including in whole or in part based on your
                    location. You will be given the opportunity to opt out of Location-based Services.
                    If you choose to enable Location-based Services, SuperSolver may collect your location
                    based on information provided by you or available from your web browser or mobile
                    device, including, if available, GPS, IP Address or cell tower information. If you
                    choose to disable Location-based Services, you will not be able to utilize certain
                    features of the Services.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique application number --</strong> Certain services may include a unique
                    application number that is not associated with your account or you. This number
                    and information about your installation (e.g., operating system type, version number)
                    may be sent to SuperSolver when you install or uninstall that service or when that
                    service periodically contacts our servers (for example, to request automatic updates
                    to the software).</li>
                <li><strong>Other sites --</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to SuperSolver services
                    only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites
                    that include SuperSolver applications, products or services, or links from within
                    our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files
                    on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services)
                    and develop new services;</li>
                <li>Protect the rights or property of SuperSolver or our users;</li>
                <li>With respect to location information that you provide, provide content and services
                    to you based on your location, such as displaying Content from other users of the
                    Services based on your location or allowing you to communicate with other users
                    of the Services based on your location;</li>
                <li>With respect to location information that you provide, customize search results
                    and to enable you to tag your Content with a location to enable location-based searching
                    of your Content by other users of the Service;</li>
                <li>Understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve
                    the way the Services work and look, and to create new features and functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was
                collected, then we may ask for your consent prior to such use. SuperSolver processes
                personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other
                countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.</p>
            <h4>Choices</h4>
            <p>
                Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser
                to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
                SuperSolver features and services may not function properly if your cookies are
                disabled.</p>
            <p>
                SuperSolver uses cookies on partner sites and certain SuperSolver services to help
                advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web.</p>
            <h4>Information sharing</h4>
            <p>
                We are not in the business of selling your information. We do, however, disclose
                your personally identifiable information in a variety of circumstances in connection
                with developing and maintaining the Services and operating our business. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SuperSolver may work with third party service providers in the U.S. and other jurisdictions
                    to provide website development, hosting, maintenance, transcription, and support
                    as well as other business services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these
                    service providers to complete their work, these third parties may have access to
                    or process your personally identifiable information. These disclosures are generally
                    made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using
                    the information the purpose for which it was provided.</li>
                <li>The Services enables users to communicate in a variety of ways. Any personally identifiable
                    information that you voluntarily choose to include in an area accessible by other
                    users, such as Content that you submit, your public profile page or in a comment,
                    posting or other Content, will be available to other users who access that content.
                    Once you make your personally identifiable information available to others in any
                    of these ways, it may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.
                    Note that while SuperSolver gives you tools to modify which groups of users can
                    access certain of your Content and other information, we cannot guarantee that use
                    of these features will prevent access to information you post on the Service by
                    other users.</li>
                <li>SuperSolver may enable users to communicate directly with other users of the Services.
                    Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to include in
                    a communication with other users will be available to such other users, in accordance
                    with any privacy settings you have enabled for such communication.</li>
                <li>SuperSolver may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable
                    information with interested third parties, to assist such parties in understanding
                    the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services,
                    advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality of the Services.</li>
                <li>SuperSolver may also disclose your information if required to do so by law or in
                    the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or useful to comply with state
                    and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), to respond to a court order, judicial
                    or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement
                    activity.</li>
                <li>SuperSolver works to promote a safe and reliable service for all users. We reserve
                    the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate
                    or necessary to take precautions against liability; to protect SuperSolver and others
                    from fraudulent, abusive, predatory, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate
                    and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government
                    enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Services; or to
                    protect or vindicate the rights, property, or personal safety of SuperSolver, our
                    users, or others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If SuperSolver becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of
                some or all of its assets, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances,
                to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users in connection
                with such merger, acquisition, sale or other change of control.</p>
            <p>
                SuperSolver may use your email address or other personally identifiable information
                to send messages about the Services, such as when you receive communications from
                another user, promotional messages related to the Services and the activities of
                third parties we work with, and communications on behalf of other users who think
                you may be interested in the Services or certain content available on the Services.
                Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications,
                either through links provided in the messages, or by updating your account preferences
                through the Services.</p>
            <h4>Information security</h4>
            <p>
                We take certain security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access
                to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include
                internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security
                measures, including encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized
                access to systems where we store personal data. Please note that this is not a guarantee
                that any such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed
                by breach of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We cannot ensure
                or warrant the security of any information you transmit to SuperSolver or to any
                third party, and you do so at your own risk. If SuperSolver learns of a security
                systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can
                take appropriate protective steps. SuperSolver may post a notice through the Services
                if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right
                to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice
                of a security breach you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@SuperSolver.com">
                    privacy@SuperSolver.com</a>.</p>
            <h4>Accessing and updating personal information</h4>
            <p>
                When you use SuperSolver services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with
                access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate
                or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained
                by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
                themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
                processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
                repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
                the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
                concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
                required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform
                this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
                effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information,
                residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active
                servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>
            <h4>Enforcement</h4>
            <p>
                SuperSolver regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive
                formal written complaints, it is SuperSolver's policy to contact the complaining
                user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory
                authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints
                regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between SuperSolver
                and an individual.</p>
            <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>
                Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post
                any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we
                will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification
                of Privacy Policy changes).</p>
