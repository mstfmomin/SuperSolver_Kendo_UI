            <p>
                2.1 SuperSolver has, and may have in the future, subsidiaries and affiliated legal
                entities around the world (" Subsidiaries and Affiliates " ). Sometimes, these companies
                will be providing the Services to you on behalf of SuperSolver itself. You acknowledge
                and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services
                to you.</p>
            <p>
                2.2 SuperSolver is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience
                for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services
                that SuperSolver provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</p>
            <p>
                2.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that SuperSolver
                may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within
                the Services) to you or to users generally at SuperSolver's sole discretion, without
                prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need
                to specifically inform SuperSolver when you stop using the Services.</p>
            <p>
                2.4 You acknowledge and agree that if SuperSolver disables access to your account,
                you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files
                or other content that is contained in your account.</p>
            <p>
                2.5 You acknowledge and agree that while SuperSolver may not currently have set
                a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through
                the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service,
                such fixed upper limits may be set by SuperSolver at any time, at SuperSolver's
                discretion.</p>
            <h4>3. Use of the Services by you</h4>
            <p>
                3.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information
                about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration
                process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree
                that any registration information you give to SuperSolver will always be accurate,
                correct and up to date.</p>
            <p>
                3.2 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the
                Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
                guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export
                of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).</p>
            <p>
                3.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means
                other than through the interface that is provided by SuperSolver, unless you have
                been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with SuperSolver. You
                specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services through
                any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall ensure
                that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on
                the Services.</p>
            <p>
                3.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts
                the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).</p>
            <p>
                3.5 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement
                with SuperSolver, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell,
                trade or resell the Services for any purpose.</p>
            <p>
                3.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that SuperSolver has no responsibility
                to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms
                and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which SuperSolver may suffer)
                of any such breach.</p>
            <p>
                3.7 The Services may provide features that enable SuperSolver to tailor your experience
                based on your location ("Location-based Services" ). For example, SuperSolver may
                utilize your location in connection with Content (described below), in order to
                customize the Content displayed to you, or to permit you to share your location
                with other users of the Services. In order to use Location-based Services, you must
                allow SuperSolver access to your localized position, which SuperSolver may access
                through a variety of means, including, if available, GPS, Internet Protocol ("IP"
                ) Address, cellular tower, and/or other location identifiers now known or later
                developed. If you choose to disable Location-based Services, you will not be able
                to utilize certain features of the Services. By authorizing SuperSolver to access
                your location, you agree and acknowledge that (i) any device data we collect from
                you in connection with the Services is directly relevant to your use of the Services
                and (ii) SuperSolver may provide Location-based Services related to your then-current
                location for the duration of your browser session. You acknowledge and agree that
                SuperSolver does not guarantee the accuracy of any location information, including
                your location information or the location information of other users of the Services,
                and your use of any Location-based Services is at your sole risk.</p>
            <h4>4. Your passwords and account security</h4>
            <p>
                4.1 You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
                of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services.</p>
            <p>
                4.2 Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to SuperSolver for
                all activities that occur under your account.</p>
            <p>
                4.3 If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account,
                you agree to notify SuperSolver immediately at <a href="mailto:info@SuperSolver.com">
                    info@SuperSolver.com</a></p>
            <h4>5. Privacy and your personal information</h4>
            <p>
                5.1 For information about SuperSolver's data protection practices, please read SuperSolver's
                <a href="/SuperSolverMobile/PrivacyPolicy">privacy policy</a>. This policy
                explains how SuperSolver treats your personal information, and protects your privacy,
                when you use the Services.</p>
            <p>
                5.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with SuperSolver's privacy policies.</p>
            <h4>6. Content in the Services</h4>
            <p>
                6.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer
                software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images)
                which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are
                the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such
                information is referred to below as the "Content."</p>
            <p>
                6.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including
                but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the
                Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to SuperSolver (or by other persons
                or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
                or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless
                you have been specifically told that you may do so by SuperSolver or by the owners
                of that Content, in a separate agreement.</p>
            <p>
                6.3 SuperSolver reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen,
                review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service.
                For some of the Services, SuperSolver may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual
                content. In addition, there are commercially available services and software to
                limit access to material that you may find objectionable.</p>
            <p>
                6.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that
                you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you
                use the Services at your own risk.</p>
            <p>
                6.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that SuperSolver has no responsibility
                to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display
                while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any
                loss or damage which SuperSolver may suffer) by doing so.</p>
            <h4>7. Proprietary rights</h4>
            <p>
                7.1 You acknowledge and agree that SuperSolver (or SuperSolver's licensors) own
                all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual
                property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be
                registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further
                acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential
                by SuperSolver and that you shall not disclose such information without SuperSolver's
                prior written consent.</p>
            <p>
                7.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with SuperSolver, nothing in the
                Terms gives you a right to use any of SuperSolver's trade names, trade marks, service
                marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.</p>
            <p>
                7.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features
                in a separate written agreement with SuperSolver, then you agree that your use of
                such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions
                of the Terms, and SuperSolver’s brand feature use guidelines as updated from time
                to time. These guidelines can be viewed by requesting such information from SuperSolver
                at <a href="mailto:info@SuperSolver.com">info@SuperSolver.com</a>.</p>
            <p>
                7.4 Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, SuperSolver acknowledges
                and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display
                on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist
                in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever
                in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing
                with SuperSolver, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing
                those rights and that SuperSolver has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
            <p>
                7.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) that may be affixed to or contained
                within the Services.</p>
            <p>
                7.6 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by SuperSolver,
                you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark,
                trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended
                to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.</p>
            <h4>8. License from SuperSolver</h4>
            <p>
                8.1 SuperSolver gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
                non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by SuperSolver as part

                SuperSolver, in writing.</p>
            <p>
                8.3 Unless SuperSolver has given you specific written permission to do so, you may
                not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a
                security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer
                any part of your rights to use the Software.</p>

                9.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content that you
                submit, post or display on or through, the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying

            <h4>11. Ending your relationship with SuperSolver</h4>
            <p>
                11.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or SuperSolver
                as set out below.</p>
            <p>
                11.2 If you want to terminate your legal agreement with SuperSolver, you may do
                so by (a) notifying SuperSolver at any time and (b) closing your accounts for all
                of the Services that you use, where SuperSolver has made this option available to
                you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to SuperSolver’s address that is set
                out at the beginning of these Terms.</p>
            <p>
                11.3 SuperSolver may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if: (A)
                you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly
                shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of
                the Terms); or (B) SuperSolver is required to do so by law (for example, where the
                provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or (C) the partner with
                whom SuperSolver offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with
                SuperSolver or ceased to offer the Services to you; or (D) SuperSolver is transitioning
                to no longer providing the Services to users in the country in which you are resident
                or from which you use the service; or (E) the provision of the Services to you by
                SuperSolver is, in SuperSolver’s opinion, no longer commercially viable.</p>
            <p>
                11.4 Nothing in this Section shall affect SuperSolver’s rights regarding provision
                of Services under Section 2 of the Terms.</p>
            <p>
                11.5 When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities
                that you and SuperSolver have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of Section
                18.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.</p>
            <h4>12. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</h4>
            <p>
                12.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 12 AND 13, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT
                SUPERSOLVER’S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED
                OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN
                WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR
                DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL
                OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS THAT ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR
                JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM
                EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
            <p>
                12.2 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR
                SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND â€œ AS AVAILABLE.</p>
            <p>
                12.3 IN PARTICULAR, SUPERSOLVER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS
                DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT: (A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET
                YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (B) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE
                OR FREE FROM ERROR, (C) ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE
                OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, AND (D) THAT DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION
                OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICES WILL BE
                CORRECTED.</p>
            <p>
                12.4 ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES
                IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
                FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS
                FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.</p>
            <p>
                12.5 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM SUPERSOLVER
                OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN
                THE TERMS.</p>
            <p>
                12.6 SUPERSOLVER FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY
                KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
                AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
            <h4>13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
            <p>
                13.1 SUBJECT TO OVERALL PROVISION IN SECTION 12.1 ABOVE, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND
                AND AGREE THAT SUPERSOLVER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL

                BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF: (I) ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU
                ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADVERTISING, OR AS A RESULT OF
                ANY RELATIONSHIP OR TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ADVERTISER OR SPONSOR WHOSE
                ADVERTISING APPEARS ON THE SERVICES; (II) ANY CHANGES WHICH SuperSolver MAY MAKE

            <p>
                13.2 THE LIMITATIONS ON SuperSolver’S LIABILITY TO YOU IN SECTION 13.1 ABOVE SHALL
                APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUPERSOLVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF
                THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.</p>

            <p>
                15.1 Some of the Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements
                and promotions. These advertisements may be targeted to the content of information
                stored on the Services, queries made through the Services or other information.</p>
            <p>
                15.2 The manner, mode and extent of advertising by SuperSolver on the Services are

            <p>
                15.3 In consideration for SuperSolver granting you access to and use of the Services,
                you agree that SuperSolver may place such advertising on the Services.</p>

            <p>
                16.1 The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources.
                SuperSolver may have no control over any web sites or resources that are provided
                by companies or persons other than SuperSolver.</p>
            <p>
                16.2 You acknowledge and agree that SuperSolver is not responsible for the availability
                of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products

            <p>
                16.3 You acknowledge and agree that SuperSolver is not liable for any loss or damage
                which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites

                17.1 SuperSolver reserves the right to update, modify, add, or remove portions of
                the Terms at any time without prior notice. We encourage you to review the Terms
                periodically for changes. The Terms will identify the date of last update. Your
                continued use of the Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding
                acceptance of such changes. In the case of material changes to the Terms, SuperSolver
                will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change, such as through sending
                an email to any address you may have used to register for an account, through a
                pop-up window, or other similar mechanism.</p>
            <p>
                17.2 In the event that such modifications materially alter your rights or obligations
                hereunder, such modified Terms will become effective upon the earlier of (i) your
                continued use of the Services with actual knowledge of such modified Terms, or (ii)
                30 days from publication of such modified terms on the SuperSolver Site.</p>
            <h4>18. General legal terms</h4>
            <p>
                18.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your
                use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase
                goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other
                services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the
                company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship
                with these other companies or individuals.</p>
            <p>
                18.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and SuperSolver
                and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which SuperSolver
                may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any
                prior agreements between you and SuperSolver in relation to the Services.</p>
            <p>
                18.3 You agree that SuperSolver may provide you with notices, including those regarding
                changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.</p>
            <p>
                18.4 You agree that if SuperSolver does not exercise or enforce any legal right
                or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which SuperSolver has the benefit
                of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of SuperSolver’
                s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to SuperSolver.</p>
            <p>
                18.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed
                from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions
                of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
            <p>
                18.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                SuperSolver is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that
                such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision
                of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than
                this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
            <p>
                18.7 The Terms, and your relationship with SuperSolver under the Terms, shall be
                governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of
                laws provisions. You and SuperSolver agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
                of the courts located within the county of New York, New York to resolve any legal
                matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that SuperSolver
                shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
                urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
