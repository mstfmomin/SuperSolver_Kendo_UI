            <ul class="Num">

                    App, or otherwise accessing or using the SuperSolver Service, you agree that you
                    have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this End User License Agreement
                    (the "EULA") and the <a href="termsandconditions.html">SuperSolver
                        Terms of Use and related policies</a> (the "Terms"), as updated from time to
                    time, which govern your use of the App and the SuperSolver Service, and which are
                    hereby incorporated herein by reference. You may use the App and the SuperSolver
                    Service only as set forth in this EULA and the Terms;</li>
                <li>Consent to the collection, use, sharing and transfer of your data as outlined in

            </ul>
            <h4>TERMS GOVERNING APP USE, LOCATION-BASED SERVICES</h4>
            <p>
                Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA and the Terms, SuperSolver grants
                you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license
                to install and use one copy of the App in object code format, solely for your personal
                use, on only one mobile device that you own or control. The App provides features
                that enable SuperSolver to tailor your experience based on your location ("Location-based
                Services"). In order to use Location-based Services, you must allow SuperSolver
                access to your localized position through your mobile phone, which SuperSolver may
                accomplish through a variety of means, including GPS location, if available. If
                you choose to disable location-based services, you will not be able to utilize certain
                features of the App. By authorizing SuperSolver to access your location, you agree
                and acknowledge that (i) device data we collect from you is directly relevant to
                your use of the App and (ii) SuperSolver may provide Location-based Services related
                to your then-current location for the next 24 hours. The SuperSolver Service may
                provide certain real time route guidance. YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE
                APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.</p>
            <h4>TERMS GOVERNING THIRD PARTY CONTENT</h4>
            <p>
                You understand that when using the App you may be exposed to content from a variety
                of sources ("Third-Party Content"), and that SuperSolver is not responsible for
                the accuracy, integrity, qualify, legality, usefulness, safety, or intellectual
                property rights of or relating to such Third-Party Content. You further understand
                and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Third-Party Content that is inaccurate,
                offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive,
                any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against SuperSolver
                with respect thereto. SuperSolver does not endorse any Third-Party Content on any
                App. Under no circumstances will SuperSolver be liable in any way for or in connection
                with any Third-Party Content, including, but not limited to, for any inaccuracies,
                errors or omissions in any Third-Party Content, any intellectual property infringement
                with regard to any Third-Party Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred
                as a result of the use of any Third-Party Content posted, electronically mailed
                or otherwise displayed or transmitted through the App.</p>
            <h4>TERMS GOVERNING USER POSTINGS</h4>
            <p>
                The App provides certain features that enable you to post a variety of content to
                the SuperSolver Service ("User Postings"). You, and not SuperSolver, are solely
                responsible for all User Postings that you make available through the SuperSolver
                Service. Similarly, SuperSolver is not responsible to you for any User Postings
                provided by other users of the SuperSolver Service.</p>
            <p>
                By submitting User Postings to SuperSolver, you hereby grant SuperSolver and its
                affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable,
                sublicensable, and transferable license (without any obligation to exercise) to
                use, reproduce, and modify your User Postings in connection with the SuperSolver
                Service, as more fully set forth in the Terms. SuperSolver does not allow infringing
                materials on the SuperSolver Service, and you agree and acknowledge that SuperSolver
                may remove User Submissions that are the subject of Digital Millennium Copyright
                Act compliant takedown notices, and to disable accounts of users determined to be
                "repeat infringers." You further agree to indemnify and hold SuperSolver and its
                affiliates harmless from all claims, damages, and liabilities arising from your
                User Postings, or any breach by you of this EULA or the Terms.</p>
            <h4>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
            <p>
                THE APP AND THE SUPERSOLVER SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY
                OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SUPERSOLVER DISCLAIMS
                ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND MERCHANTABILITY. SUPERSOLVER
                EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OR FUNCTIONALITY
                OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY, VALIDITY, OR COMPLETENESS
                OF ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SuperSolver SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
                WILL SUPERSOLVER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL
                OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP
                OR THE SUPERSOLVER SERVICE, EVEN IF SUPERSOLVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
                OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL SuperSolver'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
                ARISING OUT OF THIS EULA OR THE TERMS EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE APP.
                SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION
                OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
                LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
            <h4>NOTICE REGARDING APPLE (IF APPLICABLE)</h4>
            <p>
                You acknowledge that the Terms and this EULA are between you and SuperSolver only,
                not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the App and the content thereof.
                Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services
                with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of an App to conform to any
                applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase
                price for the relevant App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
                law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.
                Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating
                to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited
                to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to
                any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
                protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation,
                defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the App or your
                possession and use of the App infringes that third party's intellectual property
                rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the
                App. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms
                and this EULA, and upon your acceptance of the Terms and this EULA, Apple will have
                the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms and
                this EULA against you as a third party beneficiary of the Terms and this EULA. You
                hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject
                to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government
                as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government
                list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
